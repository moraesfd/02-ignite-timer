# Ignite Timer

This project was developed during the React with TypeScript training course. Concepts such as routing, forms using react-hook-form, hooks like useEffect, useReducer, context API, and data persistence in localStorage were used. The developed application acts as a cycle controller for activities, similar to the pomodoro method. You can define the task name and time, then the timer starts. There is also a history that stores previous cycles.
